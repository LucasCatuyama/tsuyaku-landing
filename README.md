# Tsuyaku (通訳) — Personal Interpretation Service

This is the official landing page for my personal interpretation and translation services between **Portuguese and Japanese**.

## 🌟 About Me

Hi! I’m **Lucas Catuyama**, a Brazilian-Japanese interpreter currently living in Japan.

I help Portuguese speakers who face language barriers in Japan by offering **real-time interpretation** and **translation** services — whether it's for:

- Medical appointments  
- Job interviews  
- City hall visits  
- School meetings  
- Legal matters  
- Everyday situations  

This website was created to showcase my work and make it easy for people to reach me.

> 💡 I'm also passionate about technology, and my dream is to become a **software engineer** in the future. This site is one of my first steps toward that goal.
